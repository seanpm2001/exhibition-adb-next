### Updated Documentation for `jsonSchemaBasedDeepGraph2JsonDocumentExtractor.ts`

#### Overview
`jsonSchemaBasedDeepGraph2JsonDocumentExtractor.ts` is a core utility in the framework, designed to transform RDF graph data into structured JSON documents. This transformation is based on a JSON Schema, making it highly adaptable to various data models. The utility implements a recursive algorithm that navigates through RDF data, constructing a comprehensive JSON document which can be directly utilized in front-end components like forms, generic tables, and detail views.

#### Functionality
- **Recursive Document Construction**: The utility employs a recursive algorithm to traverse RDF graph data. This process is controlled by multiple depth options which can be configured based on predicate type, class type, and a general maximum recursion depth.

- **Depth Control**: The depth of recursion is customizable, allowing for detailed control over how deep the algorithm should navigate into relationships like parent-child hierarchies. This feature is essential for tailoring the JSON document structure to specific front-end requirements.

- **Parameter Customization**: Users can set various parameters to control the extraction process, such as specifying different max-depth values for different types of relationships or data classes. This flexibility ensures that the resulting JSON document aligns with the intended use case.

#### Use Cases
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Efficiently handles recursive relationships, like parent-child links, within a specified depth, making it ideal for representing hierarchical data structures.

- **Semantic-Driven Views**: The JSON documents produced are well-suited for semantic-driven views in the front-end. This includes:
    - **Forms**: Populating and managing complex forms with nested or related data.
    - **Generic Tables**: Displaying data in table formats where relationships and nested information are crucial.
    - **Detail Views**: Creating detailed views of specific entities or objects, where comprehensive and nested information is presented.

#### Integration
- This utility is integral for front-end components that rely on rich, structured data. By providing a JSON Schema, the extractor can tailor the JSON document to fit the exact needs of these components, ensuring a seamless integration of complex RDF data into user-friendly interfaces.

#### Configuration
- The utility is highly configurable, allowing developers to specify the depth and nature of the data extraction process. This is critical for balancing the need for detailed data and performance considerations.

#### Example Usage
```typescript
import { jsonSchemaBasedDeepGraph2JsonDocumentExtractor } from 'utils/graph';

// Example JSON Schema
const schema: JsonSchema7 = {...};

//Load dataset or get it from a SPARQL endpoint
const ds: Dataset = await getDataset();

// Configuration for extraction
const config: Partial<WalkerOptions> = {
  omitEmptyArrays: true,
  omitEmptyObjects: true,
  maxRecursionEachRef: 2,
  maxRecursion: 3,
  skipAtLevel: 3,
  doNotRecurseNamedNodes: true,
};

const defaultPrefix = 'http://example.com/';
const entityIRI = 'http://example.com/Entity';

const jsonDocument = jsonSchemaBasedDeepGraph2JsonDocumentExtractor(
      defaultPrefix,
      entityIRI,
      ds as Dataset,
      schema,
      config,
    );
// Use the jsonDocument in various front-end components
```

#### Notes
- This utility is intended to bridge the gap between complex RDF data structures and the requirements of semantic web applications.
- Proper configuration of depth parameters are crucial for optimal performance and relevant data extraction.
- interface might change quickly currently as it still in heavy development, will be specified within a separate implementation
- It's recommended to test and iterate the depth settings based on the specific data models and front-end components in use.

This documentation provides a clear and specific overview of the `jsonSchemaBasedDeepGraph2JsonDocumentExtractor.ts` utility, focusing on its functionality, use cases, and integration into semantic web applications.

### The Comical Yet Crucial Role of `jsonSchemaBasedDeepGraph2JsonDocumentExtractor`

disclaimer: this is a comical description of the functionality of the `jsonSchemaBasedDeepGraph2JsonDocumentExtractor` crafted with the help of an artificial intelligence tool and may unintentionally contain some humor and slight inaccuracies.

Imagine you're at a grand buffet of information – a smorgasbord of semantic data from all corners of the knowledge world. You've got delicacies from Wikidata, a side of GND, a helping of Open Street Map, and even some special dishes prepared by various library institutions and MARC-based data catalogues. But here's the catch: all these dishes are served in their unique, sometimes "exotic" formats – spreadsheets, CSVs, SQL databases, XML files... you name it!

Now, enter the `jsonSchemaBasedDeepGraph2JsonDocumentExtractor`. This helper function is like your ultimate buffet plate, designed to help you sample everything without getting overwhelmed. Think of it as a magical plate that automatically reshapes itself to hold sushi rolls, soup, salad, or a slice of cake, depending on what you're scooping up.

In the world of semantic data management tools, this function is a lifesaver. It understands that while you, the user, love the variety of data sources available, you don't necessarily want to juggle the complex utensils (read: graph operations) required to enjoy them. Instead, you prefer to have a simple, document-centric way to map your data feast onto your plate.

Here’s how it humorously yet effectively handles the chaos:

1. **Assisted Manual Form Data Input**: It's like having a knowledgeable waiter who suggests the best pairing for your data appetizers. Whether it's GND, Wikidata, or something more niche, this function helps you map these rich sources onto your forms, without you needing to understand the intricacies of their preparation.

2. **Bulk Import from Exotic Formats**: Got a treasure trove of data in a forgotten Excel dungeon or a CSV cave? No problem! The `jsonSchemaBasedDeepGraph2JsonDocumentExtractor` is like an experienced treasure hunter, adept at extracting valuable insights from these ancient relics and translating them into a more palatable format.

3. **Mapping Models**: The tool acknowledges a universal truth in the data world – the ever-recurring pattern of trying to fit square pegs (one data model) into round holes (another model). It doesn’t just force them to fit; it expertly carves out a square hole or rounds off the peg, making the integration seamless.

4. **Dealing with Distributed Knowledge Sources**: Like a masterful conductor of an orchestra, it harmonizes the different instruments (data sources) into a symphony (unified data model). It ensures that the violins (wikidata), cellos (GND), and flutes (library catalogs) all play in unison, creating a melodious data experience.

In summary, the `jsonSchemaBasedDeepGraph2JsonDocumentExtractor` may have a name that's a mouthful, but it's the hero we need in the complex world of semantic data management. It's the bridge between the vast ocean of distributed knowledge sources and the tranquil island of user-friendly data models. A toast to this unsung hero, making the lives of implementers and domain experts a whole lot easier – and more delightful! 🍷🌉📚

### Overview of Interface Abstraction for Search, List, and Detail Observation

The framework provides a layered architecture to abstract interfaces for search, list, full-text search, and entity detail observation. These interfaces are designed to interact with a storage backend, which can be either a SPARQL 1.1 compliant Triple/Quad store or a standardized GraphQL API. The design caters to the specific features and subtle differences of various databases and APIs by introducing SPARQL middlewares and specific implementations.
